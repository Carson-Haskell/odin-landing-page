# The Odin Project Web Development 101
## Project: Landing Page

A landing page created with flexbox. The purpose of this project was to implement flexbox concepts that I had been learning in the Odin Web Development 101 course. 

Will need to revisit this project in the future when I have a better understanding of flexbox to fix some of the issues.
